# Module9Week3Sprint
  This is a mini-project that displays a pattern like right angle with a number, starting from number 1.

## Getting Started
By accessing the project using the link https://github.com/Jenny-Coleman/Module9Week3Sprint you will be able to see and access all the 
files. To download and run the files on your machine you need to "Clone or download", you will find this a button that will allow you 
to do this on the right (it is a green button with the words "Clone or download" on it). To run it, it is recommended that you clone to 
GitHub Desktop and run it on Visual Studio but you can download a zip file and run it on any Java IDE.

## Prerequisites
GitHub Desktop - https://desktop.github.com/
Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Installing
On GitHub: Once you have installed it, open it and sign-in or sign-up. Then start the tutorial desktop to see how to use GitHub.
On Visual Studio Code: open it and start a new file. If you are able to do that then Visual Studio Code is installed correctly.

## Running the tests
Once the file is cloned open it in GitHub. GitHub will allow you to open it in Visual Studio Code or run it. Run it to test the code,
fix any errors and run it again. Repeat this until there are no errors.

## Built With
GitHub - Software used for software development version control using Git
Word - For the documentation
